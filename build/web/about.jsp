                <h2>About Marc "The FreacanRican" Navarro</h2><br>
                <p>Marc has been boxing since he was a kid, and he has a true passion for all aspects. Currently holding 3 Pro K1 titles and a British boxing cruiser wight title.</p>

                <p>Fighting against some of the best fighters in the UK, not only in K1 but in boxing too.</p>

                <p>Which means Marc really knows what he is talking about and believes in practicing what he preaches. </p>
